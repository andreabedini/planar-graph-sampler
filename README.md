This is my copy of Eric Fusy's algorithm for the uniform random sampling of
planar graphs in linear time.

The algorithm has been presented in the following publication by Eric himself:

> Uniform random sampling of planar graphs in linear time.
> [Random Structures and Algorithms 35(4): 464-522 (2009)]
> (http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~fusy/Articles/Fusy08_planar_graphs.pdf).

This repository contains the code I used to generate the graphs for:

> A tree-decomposed transfer matrix for computing exact Potts model partition
> functions for arbitrary graphs, with applications to planar graph colourings.
> [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 43 (2010)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/43/38/385001).
