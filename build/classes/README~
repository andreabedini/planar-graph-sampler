In the current state of implementation, the "main" procedure launchs a Boltzmann sampler 
for "triply derivated" connected planar graphs, with three different values of the parameter x.
The three values correspond to an expected size of 1000, 10000, and 100000, respectively.

To run the sampler, go to the directory BoltzmannPlanarGraphs/build/classes and type "java boltzmannplanargraphs.Main",
then type the expected size you want (1000 or 10000 or 100000)
