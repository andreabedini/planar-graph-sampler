In the current state of implementation, the "main" procedure launchs a Boltzmann sampler 
for "triply derivated" connected planar graphs, with three possible values of the parameter x.
The three values correspond to an expected size of 1000, 10000, and 100000, respectively.

To run the sampler, go to the directory BoltzmannPlanarGraphs/build/classes and type "java boltzmannplanargraphs.Main",
then type the expected size you want (1000 or 10000 or 100000).
The procedure returns a random connected planar graph. The basic informations (number of vertices/edges) are
printed in the shell, whereas the whole graph is printed in the file "BoltzmannPlanarGraphs/ListEdges.txt":
each line of the file corresponds to an edge of the graph. The graph can be drawn by loading "ListEdges.txt"
in the free software "pigale" available at http://pigale.sourceforge.net

The evaluation of the generating functions of planar graphs are done using Maple based on the
exact expressions of Gimenez and Noy, see the file "Evaluation.mws".
These values are needed to calculate the branching probabilities of the samplers, which are in the file 
"BoltzmannPlanarGraphs/src/dataWithEvaluations/values_planar".
